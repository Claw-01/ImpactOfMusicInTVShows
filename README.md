# Impact Of Music In TV Shows

We all know the importance of soundtracks in movies and TV shows. The precision in selecting or even creating special songs for each film allows you to enjoy a unique atmosphere that makes you feel like you're inside the movie.

Sometimes, TV shows or movies allow audiences to discover existing songs.

Stranger Things was a phenomenon in 2016. A show inspired by the '80s, which is evident in the clothing, the home decor, and, of course, the songs the characters listened to.
In Season 1, I think everyone agrees: we can all remember the famous song 'Should I Stay or Should I Go' by The Clash. Jonathan tells Will that the tape will 'totally change your life', and  it's with that that this song takes center stage, serving as the central theme of one of the series' scenes.

I checked The Clash's popularity on Spotify and found that "Should I Stay or Should I Go" is their Top 1. But the Stranger Things' good musical taste doesn't end there, as in the Season 4 we were able to discover another important song that drives the plot: "Running Up That Hill" by Kate Bush. In this case, we find that song in the artist's Top 4. With Charmetric we can see the huge increase in Kate Bush's listeners in June 2022, the month in which we were able to watch Stranger Things Season 4.
